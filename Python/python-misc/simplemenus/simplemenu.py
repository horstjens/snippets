    simplemenu.py
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Very simple approach to implement a generic, but easy to use menu system
    with basic Python data types.
    
    Each menu consists of this tuple (or list) structure:
    
        (
            ("text to be shown", <function object>),
            ("another item text", <another function object>),
            (..., ...),
            ...
        )
        
    To be more generic, each 'callable' can be used as second argument.
    
    The user can choose via an computed index, which action should be
    triggered by the core function `handle_menu`.

    This is esspecially written for beginners, so there is no magic like
    `functools.partial` or some closures to create demo functions.
